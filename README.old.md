# Decentralized Ride Booking Platform with Reactive Smart Contracts

## Overview
A next-generation ride booking platform leveraging blockchain technology and reactive smart contracts for autonomous price determination and fair marketplace dynamics. The platform utilizes real-time monitoring of blockchain events to execute predefined actions, ensuring transparent and efficient operations.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Pricing System
- **Autonomous Price Determination**
  - Based on driver-to-rider ratio in real-time
  - Utilizes governance tokens for price modulation
  - Implements multiplier effects based on various factors

### 2. Smart Contract Architecture
- **Reactive Smart Contracts**
  - Autonomous monitoring of blockchain events
  - Real-time execution of predefined actions
  - Instant payment settlement between parties

### 3. Location-Based Services
- **Proximity Analysis**
  - Dynamic calculation of nearby drivers and riders
  - Location radius-based matching
  - Integration with Google Maps API for standard navigation

### 4. Price Influencing Factors
- **External Data Sources**
  - Weather conditions (via blockchain oracle)
  - Traffic conditions (trusted API/oracle)
  - Fuel prices
  - Surge demand calculations
  - Current driver-to-rider ratio

### 5. Fair Rating System
- Blockchain-based immutable review system
- Transparent feedback mechanism
- Impact on driver and rider reputation

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Components
1. **Smart Contracts**
   - Driver availability contract
   - Rider request contract
   - Payment settlement contract
   - Rating and review contract

2. **Oracles**
   - Weather data oracle
   - Traffic conditions oracle
   - Fuel price oracle

### External Integrations
1. **APIs**
   - Google Maps API for navigation and ETA
   - Weather API for condition monitoring
   - Traffic monitoring API

### Price Calculation Formula
```
Base Price * (Driver/Rider Ratio Multiplier) * (Weather Impact Factor) * (Traffic Condition Factor) * (Surge Demand Multiplier)
```
